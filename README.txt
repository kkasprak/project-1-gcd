Run the script zaZipUpScript.txt to tar and gzip 'mydirectory'
and copy it to the 'assignment' directory.

Run the script zbFileCopyScript.txt to create directory 'testdirectory'
and unzip and untar the submission from 'assignment' into 'testdirectory'.

Run the script zcCompileScript.txt to compile all the programs in
'testdirectory'.

Run the script zdExecuteScript.txt to execute all the programs that
were compiled in the previous step. Note that this redirects the output
to a file in 'testdirectory'.
